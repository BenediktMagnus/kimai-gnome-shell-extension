# Kimai Gnome Shell Extension

This is a Gnome Shell extension for Kimai, the time tracking app.

For now, it only shows whether you are currently clocked in or not. It is possible that I will add more features in the future.
Feel free to contribute if you like to!

## Installation

### From source

1. Clone this repository into a new subdirectory of `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`.
2. In the cloned directory, run `glib-compile-schemas schemas/` to compile the schemas.
3. Restart the Gnome Shell (e.g. by logging out and back in).
